# speckit.constitution - The Guiding Principles

This document outlines the core principles that govern the development of this project. Adherence to these principles is mandatory to ensure a high-quality, maintainable, and scalable application.

## 1. Clean Architecture
The project will follow the principles of Clean Architecture. This means a clear separation of concerns, with business logic independent of frameworks, UI, and database. Dependencies will point inwards, from outer layers (like UI and DB) to inner layers (containing business rules).

## 2. Type Safety
The entire codebase, both frontend (TypeScript) and backend (Python with type hints), must enforce strict type safety. This minimizes runtime errors, improves code clarity, and enables better static analysis.

## 3. Stateless JWT-based Authentication
Authentication will be stateless, using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). The backend will not maintain session state. The frontend is responsible for acquiring, storing, and sending the JWT with each authenticated request.

## 4. PEP 8 Standards
All Python code must strictly adhere to the PEP 8 style guide. Code will be linted and formatted to ensure consistency and readability across the project.
