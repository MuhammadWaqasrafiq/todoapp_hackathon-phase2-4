# speckit.specify - User Journeys and Functional Specification

This document details the user-facing functionality and behavior of the application.

## Core Requirement: User Isolation
A critical security and functional requirement is strict user isolation. A logged-in user MUST ONLY be able to view, create, update, or delete their own tasks. Any attempt to access another user's data must be rejected.

## User Journeys

### 1. User Signup
- **Actor:** An anonymous user.
- **Journey:**
  1. User navigates to the Signup page.
  2. User provides a unique email and a strong password.
  3. The system creates a new user account in the Neon DB.
  4. The user is immediately logged in and redirected to their task list.

### 2. User Login
- **Actor:** A registered user.
- **Journey:**
  1. User navigates to the Login page.
  2. User provides their email and password.
  3. The system verifies the credentials.
  4. Upon success, the system issues a JWT.
  5. The user is redirected to their task list, and the JWT is stored on the client.

### 3. Create Task
- **Actor:** A logged-in user.
- **Pre-condition:** User is authenticated.
- **Journey:**
  1. User is on their task list page.
  2. User enters a title and description for a new task.
  3. User submits the form.
  4. The system creates a new task in the Neon DB, associating it with the authenticated user's ID.
  5. The new task appears in the user's task list.

### 4. Read (View) Tasks
- **Actor:** A logged-in user.
- **Pre-condition:** User is authenticated.
- **Journey:**
  1. User navigates to the main task list page.
  2. The system retrieves and displays ONLY the tasks associated with that user's ID from the Neon DB.

### 5. Update Task
- **Actor:** A logged-in user.
- **Pre-condition:** User is authenticated and viewing their tasks.

  1. User clicks an "Edit" button on an existing task.
  2. User modifies the task's title, description, or status (e.g., "completed").
  3. User saves the changes.
  4. The system verifies the user owns the task before updating it in the Neon DB.
  5. The task list reflects the updated information.

### 6. Delete Task
- **Actor:** A logged-in user.
- **Pre-condition:** User is authenticated and viewing their tasks.
- **Journey:**
  1. User clicks a "Delete" button on an existing task.
